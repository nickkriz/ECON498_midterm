Before I got blocked by the coingecko website, I had the entire code written for the coingeko request and parsing files. The request file was almost identitcal to the newly made coinranking request file that I created. The only differences between the two files was that the coingecko website had 100 cryptocurrencies on each page whereas the coinranking website only has 50 on each, therefore more requests from the site needed to be made. Additionally, the request file from the coingecko had much longer sleep time as I was not pressed for time. However, this did not prevent me from getting blocked from the site. Also, I had the parsing file completed for the coingecko website. This file was also very similar to the parsing file that I now have for the new coinranking webiste that I am using. The only major differences was where the data was located. On the coingecko site I was able to figure out which classes were neccessary for me to enter into in order to webscrape the data that I wanted for comparison. On the new parsing file that I have for coinranking, it was a little more difficult as the table isn't the only thing on the main homepage like it is for the coingecko site and the coinmarketcap that we had previosuly done in class as well. During my proccess of creating the dataset csv file for the coingecko site I was unable to continue as I was blocked from the site. I decided to replace my old files that I had for the coingecko with the new files that I have for coinranking to ensure that there was neat organizaiton in both the html files and the parsed files folders.
